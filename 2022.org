#+title: 2022

This is the one page of my 2022.

* Learning
*** Time management
粥左罗的时间管理课程
*** Personal Brand: How to build your own IP
*** Essential Learning
*** Geekbang: Software Architecture course
What I lean from the course is getting a better understanding of what the whole picture of architecture looks like and a very different view from the architect perspective.

These are some blogs I write

* Cool Stuff I Discovered This Year
** Books
Reading is always a big part of my life. Just like eating, I read everyday.
It's bit out of plan that I would read 50 books in first 6 months.

Mostly non-fiction.
